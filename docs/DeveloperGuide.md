## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

###  Undo feature

#### Description

The Undo feature allows users to revert an undo-able command. The `UndoCommand` serves as the entry point for users to
initiate the undo process.

#### Implentation details

The `UndoCommand` is implemented as follows:
- **Command Word**: `undo` or `u`
- **Usage**: `undo [number]`
- **Command Format**
    - `undo`: Undoes the last undo-able command
    - `undo [number]`: Undoes the specified number of undo-able commands
- **Validation**: The `UndoCommandParser` parses user input, ensuring it adheres to the expected format.
  If the input is invalid or incomplete, appropriate error messages are generated.
- **Execution**: Upon successful validation, the `UndoCommandParser` returns a `UndoCommand` object. The object
  then interacts with the model to identify and undo the desired number of previous commands

<puml src=diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml width="250"/>

#### Rationale:

In the current implementation, the `UndoCommand` relies on undoable commands storing the previous details of the patient as fields.
For example, the undo of an "add" command stores the details of the added patient and undoing it will simply delete the added patient,
representing a reversal of the addition. This approach prioritizes simplicity and efficiency, ensuring a quick and reliable undo operation.
By leveraging the existing structures and operations in the application, this method avoids the need for additional data storage and processing.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src=diagrams/UndoActivityDiagram.puml width="250"/>


#### Alternative Implementation

**Alternative 1:**: Explore more sophisticated undo strategies, such as storing the state of the address book after each command.
* Pros: Accuracy: This approach ensures a more precise representation of the application's history, capturing nuanced changes in the address book. It is particularly beneficial in scenarios where specific details matter.
* Cons:
    1. Increased Complexity: Implementing a system to capture and manage snapshots of the address book after every command introduces additional complexity to the codebase.
    2. Resource Overhead:  Storing snapshots after each command may increase the application's resource usage,


### Implementation of Single, optional Appointment Field

#### Proposed Implementation

_{Explain how `Appointment` as an optional field is implemented}_

_{Explain how `Appointment` is stored inside each `Person`}_

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Parsing of `Appointment` Field**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use of the single `ap/` flag.
  * Pros: Easy to input on the user-end.
  * Cons: Hard to separate time fields, could be troublesome to implement a parse format string.

* **Alternative 2:** Use of 2 flags to denote start and end time for appointment.
  * Pros: Immediate clarity on what fields to implement, and how to parse input string.
  * Cons: Strong dependence between 2 flags requires more fail-state management.

**Aspect: Value to store `Appointment` as**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use of raw `String` format for Appointment
  * Pros: Far easier to parse and store as an object.
  * Cons: Hard to extend upon in future use-cases, such as reminders, etc.

* **Alternative 2:** Use of `DateTime`-related objects for Appointment
  * Pros: More direct paths of feature extension in the long run.
  * Cons: Translation to and from `DateTime` objects can be non-trivial.

We are currently in the process of switching to Alternative 2, as Alternative 1 was chosen primarily for its
fast implementation for the MVP.

### Delete Feature

#### Description

The `DeleteCommand` allows users to delete a patient's profile or a specified field from the patient's profile.

#### Implementation Details

The `DeleteCommand` is implemented as follows:
- **Command Word**: The command word for this feature is `delete`
- **Usage**: Users invoke the `DeleteCommand` by specifying the command word, followed by the name or IC of the person they wish to delete and any fields they wish to delete.
- **Command Format**: `delete n/Name or id/IC_Number[Fields] ...`
- **DeletePersonDescriptor**: The `DeleteCommand` relies on an `DeletePersonDescriptor` to capture which fields the user wishes to delete from the patient's profile. The descriptor will be passed to the `DeleteCommand` to execute the deletion.
- **Validation**: The `DeleteCommand` performs validation to ensure that the IC or Name provided is valid.
- **Execution**: When executed, the `DeleteCommand` identifies the patient to be deleted based on the provided name or IC. When the patient is found, if no there are no specified fields to delete, the entire patient profile will be deleted from the database. Otherwise, the specified fields will be deleted from the patient's profile.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src=diagrams/DeleteActivityDiagram.puml width="250"/>

#### Rationale

- **Flexibility**: The `DeleteCommand` provides flexibility to users, allowing them to choose what to be deleted from the patient's profile, instead of an "all-or-nothing" approach.
- **Data Accuracy**: The `DeleteCommand` allows users to delete outdated or incorrect information from the patient's profile, ensuring that the database is up-to-date and accurate.
- **Privacy and Compliance**: The `DeleteCommand` supports "right to erasure" under the PDPA, allowing users to delete patient's information from the database when requested.

#### Alternative Implementation

- **Alternative 1**: The `DeleteCommand` could be implemented as a `DeleteFieldCommand` and a `DeletePersonCommand`. The `DeleteFieldCommand` will delete the specified fields from the patient's profile, while the `DeletePersonCommand` will delete the entire patient profile from the database. This approach will require the user to invoke two commands to delete a patient's profile and the specified fields from the patient's profile. This approach is not chosen as it is less intuitive and requires more effort from the user.


### Addition of Interface for Find-type commands

#### Proposed Implementation

_{Explain how there is overlap in function for `find`, `delete`, `edit`}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Improved GUI

_The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is designed using JavaFX and employs a combination of HBox, VBox, and StackPane layouts. It also utilizes specific color choices to create an appealing and user-friendly interface._

_Developers can use this information as a reference when working with the HealthSync GUI code._

#### Layout Structure:

The primary layout structure for the HealthSync GUI is based on HBox and VBox containers, which allow for a flexible arrangement of UI elements.

1. HBox
   Location: The HBox is the top-level container in the GUI and spans the entire application window.

2. VBox
   Location: There are two VBox containers within the HBox, which are responsible for organizing various elements of the GUI.

StackPane
The StackPane is used to organize specific UI elements within the VBox containers. It allows for the layering of elements and effective management of screen real estate.

1. StackPane (Person List)

   Location: Inside the first VBox (fx:id="personList").
2. StackPane (Logger Panel)

    Location: Also inside the first VBox (fx:id="personList").
3. StackPane (Result Display, Command Box, and Status Bar)

    Location: These StackPanes are located inside the second VBox

#### Color Choice:

The HealthSync GUI utilizes specific color choices to create a visually pleasing and organized interface, while still maintaining the original Dark Theme.

1. Primary Colour: #43314E
2. Secondary Colour: #231335


### Edit Feature

#### Description

The `EditCommand` allows users to modify the details of an existing person within the address book.

#### Implementation Details

The `EditCommand` is implemented as follows:
- **Command Word**: The command word for this feature is `edit`.
- **Usage**: Users invoke the `EditCommand` by specifying the command word, followed by the name or IC of the person they wish to edit and the fields they wish to modify.
    - The command format is: `edit n/NAME or id/IC_NUMBER [Fields] ...`.
- **EditPersonDescriptor**: The `EditCommand` relies on an `EditPersonDescriptor` to capture the details to edit the person with. This descriptor allows for updating various attributes of the person, such as phone, email, address, appointment, and medical histories.
- **Validation**: The `EditCommand` performs validation to ensure at least one field to edit is provided. It also checks for consistency when both a name and IC are provided.
- **Execution**: When executed, the `EditCommand` identifies the person to edit based on the provided name and/or IC. If the person is found, it creates an `editedPerson` with the desired changes. The person is then updated with the new details.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/EditActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Rationale

- **Flexibility**: The `EditCommand` provides flexibility to users by allowing them to choose whether to edit a person by name or IC, as per their convenience.
- **Maintaining Data Integrity**: The feature is designed to maintain the integrity of the address book by updating existing entries rather than creating new ones.

#### Alternatives Considered

- **Alternative 1**: Using Numbering Index to specify the person to edit. In this approach, users would provide the index of the person based on the list instead of specifying a name or IC. For example, they could use a command like `edit 1 p/93029393` to edit the first person of the list with the phone number.
    - **Pros**:
        - **Simplicity**: Using an index is straightforward and doesn't require specifying a name or IC.
        - **Reduced Ambiguity**: Using an index avoids potential ambiguity when multiple individuals have the same name.

    - **Cons**:
         - **Lack of Context**: Users might find it challenging to remember the index of a particular person, especially in a large address book.
         - **Potential Errors**: If the list of persons changes (e.g., due to deletions or additions), the numbering index could become outdated, leading to errors.
         - **Limited Identifiability**: Index numbers do not provide any context about the person, which may be confusing when there are multiple people with the same name or similar information.

### Find Feature

#### Description

The `FindCommand` allows users to find existing person(s) within the patient list, using their name or NRIC, and view their field data.

#### Implementation Details

The `FindCommand` is implemented as follows:
- **Command Word**: The command word for this feature is `find`.
- **Usage**: Users invoke the `FindCommand` by specifying the command word, followed by the name or NRIC of the person(s) they wish to find.
    - The command format is: `find n/NAME` or `find id/IC_NUMBER`.
- **`execute` method**: The `FindCommand` executes the search by using the specified predicates (`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` or `IdContainsKeywordsPredicate`) to filter and list all persons matching the search criteria.
- **Validation**: The `FindCommand` performs validation to ensure at least one keyword is provided. It searches based on either name or NRIC, to speed up the search and prevent possible conflicts if name and NRIC do not match each other.
- **Execution**: When executed, the `FindCommand` identifies the person(s) being searched for based on the provided name or NRIC. If a name is provided as keyword, a `FindCommand(NameContainsKeywordsPredicate)` is created, and if an NRIC is provided as keyword, a `FindCommand(IdContainsKeywordsPredicate)` is created. `updateFilteredPersonList` will then update the filter of the filtered person list to filter by the given name or NRIC predicate (keyword).

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" width="400" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/FindActivityDiagram.puml" width="500" />

#### Rationale

- **Flexibility**: The `FindCommand` provides flexibility to users by allowing them to choose whether to find a person by name or NRIC, whichever is faster or available.
- **User Experience**: The keyword matching is case-insensitive, making the search faster and more user-friendly.
- **Data Integrity**: The feature is designed to maintain the integrity of the patient list by not changing any of the patient data.

#### Alternatives Considered

- **Alternative 1**: Using only name to find patients.
    - **Pros**:
        - **Standardisation**: The command format is fixed and will always only be `find n/NAME`, which may be easier to remember.
        - **User Convenience**: Searching primarily by name is a common way to look up a patient in a healthcare system and users may be more familiar with this method.

    - **Cons**:
        - **Potential Errors**: If patients' names change over time, there may be failed searches and other identifiers, like NRIC, may be needed.
        - **Limited Identifiability**: If multiple patients share the same name, they will be indistinguishable name-wise and other identifiers, like NRIC, may be needed.


- **Alternative 2**: Requiring both name and NRIC keywords to find patients within a single find command.
  - **Pros**:
    - **Enhanced Precision**: Combining both name and NRIC is a more unique identification method, making it easier to find a patient sharing a name with other patients.
    - **Patient Verification**: Searching by both criteria adds a layer of verification, ensuring the correct patient is selected.

  - **Cons**:
    - **Additional User Effort**: Users need to provide both name and NRIC, which may take longer or require extra effort, especially if they only have one piece of information readily available.
    - **Increased Ambiguity**: If the name keyword does not match the NRIC keyword, this may lead to potential confusion in which patient is being searched for.

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. Our current app is unable to handle scenarios where patients share the same name. We plan to make it possible for
   users to add patients with the same name into HealthSync.
2. Our current app does not handle text wrapping on the UI well, and certain text labels may be obscured when user input
   is too long. We plan to explicitly denote the labels on the individual UI cards and allow inputs to stretch its
   container should it be a long input, so users would be able to discern easily what elements they are looking at on
   the UI.
