### Project: HealthSync

HealthSync is an application designed to streamline the workflow of healthcare center frontdesk staff by allowing them to efficiently register and access patient information within 2-3 minutes. It offers a user-friendly platform that enhances patient management, appointment scheduling, and health record retrieval, ultimately improving care delivery and saving valuable time for healthcare professionals.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit patient fields.
    * What it does: allows the user to edit existing patient fields. If the fields do not exist, the field will be created automatically.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because this feature allows the user to elegantly update patient details.
