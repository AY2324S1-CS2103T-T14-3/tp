### Project: HealthSync

HealthSync is an application designed to streamline the workflow of healthcare center frontdesk staff by allowing them to efficiently register and access patient information within 2-3 minutes. It offers a user-friendly platform that enhances patient management, appointment scheduling, and health record retrieval, ultimately improving care delivery and saving valuable time for healthcare professionals.
