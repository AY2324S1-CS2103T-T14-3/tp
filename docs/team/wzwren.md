### Project: HealthSync

HealthSync is an application designed to streamline the workflow of healthcare center frontdesk staff
by allowing them to efficiently register and access patient information within 2-3 minutes.
It offers a user-friendly platform that enhances patient management, appointment scheduling,
and health record retrieval, ultimately improving care delivery and saving valuable time for healthcare professionals.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * `Appointment` field implementation, including the parsing and handling logic of
    temporal data.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=T14-3&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=WZWren&tabRepo=AY2324S1-CS2103T-T14-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Enhanced `add` feature to allow for addition of new fields added by the team.
  * Expanded `find` feature to allow for search by name, IC and Appointment.
  * Expanded `find` feature to compose multiple search fields through the use of
    the `Predicate` functional interface class.

* **Documentation for UG**:
    * Added Glossary Section for UG.
    * Hyperlinked relevant sections in UG to the Glossary.

* **Documentation for DG**:
    * Added implementation details for `Appointment`, `Predicate` and `Find` features.
